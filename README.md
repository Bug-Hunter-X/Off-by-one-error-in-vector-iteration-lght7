# Off-by-One Error in C++ Vector Iteration

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error when iterating through a `std::vector` in C++.  The code attempts to access an element beyond the valid index range, leading to undefined behavior. The solution demonstrates the correct way to iterate and highlights the importance of careful index handling.
